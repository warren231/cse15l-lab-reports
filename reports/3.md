# lab report 3
I chose `grep` as the command to focus on.
## -c [source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/grep.htm)
```shell
grep -c "The" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToM*
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToMadeira.txt:142

written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToMalaysia.txt:350
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToMallorca.txt:129
```
What -c is doing is __counting the number of times__ the pattern "The" appears in files that match written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToM*.

```shell

What this is doing is counting the number of times the pattern "film" appears in files that match written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereTo*.

-c is useful for seeing how frequent or relevant an exact phrase is for certain files, basically keyword analysis.

## -i [source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/grep.htm)
```shell
grep -i " Most " written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-H*
To the pirates and privateers who sailed the Caribbean in the early 16th century, the fortress of El Morro at San Juan represented the might, and the wealth, of the Spanish Crown. Lured by the promise of treasure galleons and stores of ammunition, some pirates worked independently; others, however, were employed by the various European crowns, particularly the British, to help carry on their power struggles in the colonial world. Puerto Rico suffered from constant attacks. The most poignant, though not typical, case involved raids against the coastal hamlet of San Germán. Two French pirate ships first ravaged the village in 1528. It happened again in 1538 and three times in the following five years. After every attack the settlers put out the fires, buried the dead, and rebuilt San Germán. In 1554, after the sixth sacking, the settlers decided to move inland to the town’s present hilltop location. With remarkable persistence the pirates climbed all the way, twice, just to pillage San Germán.
Soon after this, the Spanish began building a thick defensive wall all around San Juan. With an average height of 40 feet (12 m), it was a formidable site, and is still one of the most impressive parts of the old city. It seems to have impressed generations of marauders; once it was complete, they stayed away for more than 150 years.
For Spain the 19th century was a bitter slide from imperial might to the status of a has-been. By the early 1800s independence movements had overthrown Spanish rule in most of the Western Hemisphere. Madrid’s most important remaining possessions were the island colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico, both of which were chafing under the yoke of colonial rule and the bitter system of slavery. To squash subversive ideas about independence in Puerto Rico, Madrid imposed ruthless military control. The most memorable incident occurred in 1868 in the mountain town of Lares, when government forces crushed an uprising of secessionists, killing or jailing the insurgents, and many innocent victims. The event is remembered as El Grito de Lares (the cry of Lares).
The population was initially little better off under its new landlord. Most Puerto Ricans were tied to the large agricultural companies — they lived in company houses and were paid in tokens that could only be spent at company stores. They didn’t starve, but they didn’t thrive, either. A few strong voices were eventually raised: some proposed radical action while others advocated working within the system for a more democratic society. One especially prominent activist was Muñoz Marín Rivera, who is credited with helping to move Puerto Rico toward the 20th century.

What -i is doing is showing places the pattern " Most ", __but case-insensitive__, appears in files that match written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-H*.

```shell
grep -ic "The" written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToM*
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToMadeira.txt:622
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToMadrid.txt:740
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToMalaysia.txt:1807
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToMallorca.txt:713
```
What this is doing is counting the number of times the pattern "The", but case-insensitive now, appears in files that match written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/WhereToM*. So the counts are higher than previously because strings like "the" and "THE" are now matched, instead of just capital-T "The".

-i is useful when you want to search for all uses of a certain word or phrase without having to do separate searches for all possible capitalizations.

## -r [source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/grep.htm)
```shell
grep -r "The winners" written_2/
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Abernathy/ch3.txt:A century later, retailing success is often attributed to combining effective marketing with an understanding of consumer tastes. The growth of private-label programs among retailers in the 1980s exemplifies this trend. In private-label programs, retailers create a distinctive product line under their exclusive name and license. If successful, a retailer’s private-label program can capitalize on the same type of strong brand recognition that has yielded profits to companies like Levi Strauss or more recently Tommy Hilfiger. For example, the success of The Gap’s jeans, J. C. Penney’s Arizona line, and Sears’s Canyon River Blue line has led to erosion of the market share held by the two leading jeans manufacturers, Levi Strauss and VF Corporation.7 According to Standard & Poor’s, “In the 1980s the standout performers in retailing developed a sustainable competitive advantage by differentiating themselves in the eyes of the consumer....The winners have either created new markets or revitalized old businesses with a price and product mix geared toward a narrower market.”8
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Nepal-WhatToDo.txt:Bisket, the official New Year, prompts a wild celebration in Bhaktapur. Four days before New Year, two groups of men representing different districts of the city have a tug of war over a chariot containing symbols of Kali and Bhairav. The winners keep the chariot in their district and parade it through the streets for the next several days, fuelled by rice liquor. On 14 April, a huge pole, decorated with leaves and garlands and two streamers representing snakes, is erected in a field on the outskirts.
```
What -r is doing is __recursively scanning all files within the directory__ written_2/, so that files within subdirectories of written_2/ are also included when searching for matches for "he winners".

```shell
grep -rc --include=Where* "film" written_2/

What this is doing is recursively scanning files within the directory written_2/, only including filenames that match Where*, so that files within subdirectories of written_2/ are also included when searching for matches for "he winners".

-r and its sub-option --include are useful because they make searching for patterns within a directory and its subdirectories simple, instead of using the results of `find` as arguments for the files to `grep`. Also -r doesn't need the extra filtering or suppression needs to be done to those find results so that grep doesn't warn that a path is a directory. Also, if a file pattern like Where* is nested within several subdirectories, those directories don't have to be typed out if --include is used to match for that pattern.

## -n [source](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/grep.htm)
```shell

What -n is doing is __showing line numbers for matches__ for the pattern "gam.\*ing" from scanning written_2/travel_guides/berlitz1/HistoryLasVegas.txt.

```shell
grep -rn "understated " written_2/non-fiction/
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch1.txt:35:Fifty years later, I find Schrödinger’s argument fascinating and brilliant. At once he envisioned what became, by 1953, the elucidation of the structure of DNA’s aperiodic double helix by James Watson and Francis Crick, with the famously understated comment in their original paper that its structure suggests its mode of replication and its mode of encoding genetic information.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch3.txt:16:The projected budget for the new library was not large ($1.7 million) and Billings expected a relatively modest building.* That was not what he got. All three designs were monumental. Carrère & Hastings and Howard & Cauldwell used the Modern French style, which was more ornate and allowed for more articulation to the façade than the austere Classical style that McKim opted for. All incorporated giant columns rising the full height of the two floors—Corinthian in McKim’s case, Ionic in the other two (the completed building is Corinthian). The compositional strategies were roughly similar: a monumental stair led to an elevated main floor; the entrance was placed in the center (more understated in McKim’s elegant design); statuary and urns adorned the attic. All three entrants shared a sense of what was beautiful and what was appropriate, and all were concerned with conveying the same message of permanence, dignity, and of culture rooted in the past.
written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Rybczynski/ch3.txt:18:I told my audience that I thought that the Salt Lake City library board would have a more difficult choice than their nineteenth-century New York counterparts. It was not a question of function. The Salt Lake City librarians had prepared an equally exhaustive program of requirements, so whichever architect was chosen commodity probably would be well served. As for firmness, I was reasonably sure that any of these experienced firms would build soundly. It was the consideration of delight that would make the selection harder. Gwathmey and Siegel design crisply detailed, understated buildings in a latter-day version of the International Style. Safdie, too, is a modernist, but he follows in the footsteps of Pei, and his buildings are frankly monumental—the Vancouver library had been likened to the Roman Coliseum. Moore Ruble Yudell’s work is different. Informal and animated, their eclectic Postmodern designs are likely to include ornament and architectural motifs drawn from their surroundings. Bruder, on the other hand, designs chic buildings that incorporate exposed structural elements, rough industrial materials, and sleek details. Building on the same site, fulfilling the same functional requirements, and using the same up-to-date construction technology, the four firms would produce libraries that would look different.

What this is doing is showing line numbers for matches for the pattern "understated " when recursively scanning written_2/non-fiction/ for files.

-n is useful if you want to find the exact location of a pattern in a file by its line number instead of having to do another search using the pattern within the file itself.
