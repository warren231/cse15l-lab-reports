# report 5
I wanted to try my hand at doing lab 7/lab report 4 in a bash script, so I wrote `quick.sh` in my home directory on ieng6. It contains:

```sh
CPATH=".:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar"

rm -rf lab7
git clone git@github.com:warren231/lab7.git
cd lab7
javac -cp $CPATH *.java
java -cp $CPATH org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests
sed -i "43 s/index1/index2/" ListExamples.java
javac -cp $CPATH *.java
java -cp $CPATH org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests

git commit -am "hi"
git push
```

It uses the CPATH variable used in grade.sh because it's just cleaner than having the whole classpath on all 4 lines where it's used, and it removes the lab7 directory if it exists because I don't want to manually do that each time before I do the tasks.

So I clone my fork, cd in and compile all the java files within lab7 including the tests file, run them to show they fail, fix the bug in ListExamples.java, recompile and run the tests to show they work, then stage, commit, and push my change.

I'm still running the same exact setup of my lab report 4, where I use `sed` so I don't have to interactively edit ListExamples.java. Basically, it directly changes the 43rd line of ListExamples.java, where the bug is, to use use index2 instead of index1 as the index to increment. I also use the `-am` flag in `git commit` to not have to make a separate `git add ListExamples.java` command, since `-a` stages my change.

This is pretty fast, all I have to do manually is ssh to get on ieng6, without typing my password because of the ssh keys I set up, then execute `bash quick.sh` and see the lab 7 tasks run automatically.
