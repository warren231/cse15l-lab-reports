```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URI;

class Handler implements URLHandler {
    String wholeMessage = "";

    public String handleRequest(URI url) {
        if (url.getPath().equals("/")) {
            return wholeMessage;
        } else if (url.getPath().equals("/add-message")) {
            System.out.println("Path: " + url.getPath());
            if (url.getQuery()!=null) {
                String[] parameters = url.getQuery().split("=");
                if (parameters[0].equals("s") && parameters.length > 1) {
                    String newMessage = parameters[1];
                    wholeMessage += '\n' + newMessage;
                    return String.format(wholeMessage);
                }
            }
            return String.format("Invalid query!");
        } else {
            return "404 Not Found!";
        }
    }
}

class StringServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        if(args.length == 0){
            System.out.println("Missing port number! Try any number between 1024 to 49151");
            return;
        }
        int port = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        Server.start(port, new Handler());

The handleRequest() method is called, the argument is the URI /add-message?s=hello, and before the method is called, the variable wholeMessage is "". After the method is called, wholeMessage becomes "\nhello".

## part 2
For the bug in reversed() in ArrayExamples.java, a failure-inducing input is the array { 1, 2, 3, 4 }.
```java
  @Test
  public void testReversed2() {
    int[] input1 = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 4, 3, 2, 1 }, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
}
```
An input that doesn't induce a failure is { 0, 0 }.
```java
  @Test
  public void testReversed3() {
    int[] input1 = { 0, 0 };
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 0, 0 }, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
}
```
The symptom is that the elements in the returned array are 0.

The old code is
```java
  // Returns a *new* array with all the elements of the input array in reversed
  // order
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
```

The bug is that in the for loop, the indices in arr are set to elements in the newly-created newArray that has 0's by default for all its elements, and also that arr is returned, which would return an array of 0s instead of the array of the original values in arr but reversed. A fix is that instead, newArray indices are set to elements in arr (in reverse, but that was correct in the first place) and newArray gets returned, so that the reversed array is given and not the orginal one.

The new code is
```
  // Returns a *new* array with all the elements of the input array in reversed
  // order
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1]; //new array should be on the left side
    }
    return newArray;
  }
```

# part 3
These past two labs, I learned that -cp means class path and learned how to write a simple url handler in Java. I've written some in Python before but this was interesting because the different paths were handled with else statements rather than having @'s before methods to handle different paths. Another way it was interesting was that it used .split("=") to parse queries, but that wouldn't work if multiple values were used in one query (where there's &'s).
