I used ctrl+r to search my history for my ssh command, and I immediately found it after typing `s`, so I executed the command with enter and logged in. It required no password because I set up ssh keys to login.
## 5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
```
<ctrl>r git cl<enter>
```

I used the reverse history search again and found the clone command after typing `git cl`, then executed it and cloned the lab7 repository.
## 6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
```
<ctrl>r d la<enter>
<ctrl>r *.<enter>
<ctrl>r e L<enter>
```

I searched for the cd command using the middle characters `d la` to save time, executed it to move into the lab7 directory. Then I searched for the compile command with `*.` and executed it to compile all the java files in the lab7 directory. Then I searched for the command to run the tests with the middle characters `e L` and executed the tests, showing the failure.
## 7. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
```
<ctrl>r se<enter>
```

I searched for my command to edit the 43rd line of ListExamples.java (which is where the bug is) to use index2 instead of index1 for incrementing, then executed it. The -i flag in `sed` makes it change the contents of the file, rather than just printing out the text replacement.
## 8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
```
<ctrl>r *<enter>
<ctrl>r e <enter>
```

I searched for the compile command and didn't have to type the `.` this time because it was my now most recent usage of `*` in a command, then executed it, re-compiling the java files. I searched for the command to run the tests with `e `, one less character needed than before, and executed it, showing the tests now succeed.
## 9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account (you can pick any commit message!)
```
<ctrl>r -am<enter>
<ctrl>r pus<enter>

I searched for the commit command and executed it. It stages my changes and specifies a message in one line. Then, I searched for the push command and pushed my changes.
